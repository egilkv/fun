Possibly change array and assoc initialization to Json style?
But then, how to separate a {} block in a program from an initialized assoc?
Json reserved names and types:
    null, true, false
    signed decimal number, including floats
    string
    array [] and comma-separated elements.
    associative array

5 > 3 > 1  must be investigated. And also, how does it work in C?

    if (oldlen > 0 && oldlen > newlen) {

Implement function call without use of C stack

Implement non-mutable 'variables'

verify_nil can possibly be replace by assert

[]{} is an empty assoc?

Function invocation and lists should be separate things. Really

TODO allow for byte order mark and other Unicode stuff in reader

Assoc keys can be symbols, strings or integers

Have === operator in addition to ==, to require more equality of sorts

In Scheme, 'display' will print strings without the " etc while 'write' will
write S-expressions that 'read' can read. We should be able to read JSON directly.
