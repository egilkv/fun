#args
A list of command line arguments (not used by fun itself). #args[0] is the name of the program.

Compare operators of the same kind may be used N-ary, e.g. a < b < c. This does not work with 
different operators, e.g. 1 < a <= 5.

Tail call optimization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call

&& and || does lazy evaluation

You cannot use compare against #void, so
	a == #void
always yields an error message (but what about Monads?) and the result is
#void, neither #t nor #f. To test if a result is void, do:
	#type(a) == 'void

Send val to channel:
ch <- v

Receive from channel
   <- ch

ch := make(chan int)

#keys() will return range for vectors, lists and strings
