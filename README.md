**FUN** is a functional programming language.

#Basics

**Whitespace** can generally be used freely to format the code for best readability.

**Comments** work like in C, i.e. either enclosed in `/\* \*/` or from ´//' to the end of line.

**Numbers** are either integers (`42`), fractions (`22/7`) or floating point numbers (`3.14`).
*To convert an integer or fraction to floating point, simply multiply by 1.0.*

**Operators** work much like in C. Basic arithmetic operators are '+', '-', '\*' and '/'. 
Dividing two integers or quotients will yield a quotient or an integer.

Parenthesis can be used for grouping.
